    <!-- P/E Ratio -->

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <h2 class="h5">Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio</h2>
            <p>
                The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compares a company’s share price to its earnings per
                share (EPS). It is often called a “multiple” because it shows how many dollars investors
                are willing to pay for one dollar of current earnings. In formula form,
                P/E = current share price ÷ earnings per share.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the screener, a lower P/E can be interpreted as relatively “cheap” compared with peers
                or the market, while a higher P/E can signal that the stock is priced for stronger growth
                or potentially overvalued. The dashboard highlights conditions where the P/E appears cheap
                or expensive relative to a threshold you define, so you can quickly see valuation at a glance.

    <!-- Support and Resistance -->
    <div class="row mb-4">
        <div class="col-md-4 mb-3 mb-md-0">
            <img src="/images/test2.webp" class="img-fluid rounded border"
                alt="Support and resistance levels on a price chart" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <h2 class="h5">Support and Resistance</h2>
            <p>
                Support and resistance are price levels where the market has historically paused or
                reversed. Support is an area where a downtrend tends to slow or bounce because demand
                increases. Resistance is an area where an uptrend tends to stall because supply increases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The screener uses recent price history and moving averages to approximate key zones where
                price has reacted. These areas help you understand whether the current price is pressing
                into resistance, bouncing from support, or trading in the middle of a range, which ties
                directly into your risk and reward planning.

    <!-- RSI -->

        <div class="col-md-4 mb-3 mb-md-0">
            <img src="/images/test3.webp" class="img-fluid rounded border" alt="Relative Strength Index indicator" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <h2 class="h5">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</h2>
            <p>
                The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and
                magnitude of recent price changes to identify overbought or oversold conditions. RSI is
                plotted on a scale from 0 to 100. Readings above 70 are often interpreted as overbought,
                while readings below 30 are often seen as oversold.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this screener, RSI helps you quickly see whether a stock has recently experienced strong
                buying pressure or heavy selling pressure. Oversold conditions can align with potential
                support zones, while overbought conditions can cluster near resistance. Combining RSI with
                other indicators like moving averages can improve the quality of trade setups.

    <!-- EMA and SMA -->
    <div class="row mb-4">
        <div class="col-md-4 mb-3 mb-md-0">
            <img src="/images/test4.webp" class="img-fluid rounded border"
                alt="Simple and exponential moving averages on a chart" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <h2 class="h5">EMA and SMA (Moving Averages)</h2>
            <p>
                Moving averages smooth price data to reveal the underlying trend. A Simple Moving Average
                (SMA) gives equal weight to all observations in the lookback window. An Exponential Moving
                Average (EMA) gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new
                information.
            </p>
            <p>
                The screener computes moving averages such as SMA and EMA over configurable windows to
                determine whether price is trending above or below these reference levels. For example,
                being above a medium term SMA can signal bullish momentum, while trading below it can
                indicate weakness. These signals are combined with RSI and P/E to build a more complete
                technical and valuation picture.

    <!-- Price Action -->

        <div class="col-md-4 mb-3 mb-md-0">
            <img src="/images/test5.webp" class="img-fluid rounded border" alt="Price action candlestick chart" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <h2 class="h5">Price Action</h2>
            <p>
                Price action is simply the movement of a security’s price over time as plotted on a chart.
                It is the raw data from which most technical indicators are derived. Many short term traders
                focus primarily on price action patterns such as breakouts, trendlines, and candlestick
                formations to make trading decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the screener, price action shows up through recent highs and lows, trend direction, and
                how price behaves around support, resistance, and moving averages. Rather than replacing
                your judgment, the dashboard is designed to summarize these behaviours so you can more
                easily decide whether a setup fits your trading plan.
